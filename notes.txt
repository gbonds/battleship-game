TODO LIST
in order of priority
as of 2/3/21

QA: Safari  - messageArea hidden behind gameGrid, could see the end of the final stats message.
            - Reset Board button expanding on hover to accommodate larger text, when it should just be making text bolder

QA: FireFox - Reset Board button bold text looks too fuzzy, is there a better way to emphasize on hover? maybe make font slightly larger so there's more space between letters?

-clickable table cells

-displayMessage for duplicate guess (currently animation emphasizes hit/miss icon without highlighting bg like it does for the initial hit/miss)

-night/day toggle (probably should use CSS variables)

-add a README?
